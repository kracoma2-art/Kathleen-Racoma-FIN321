## Executive Summary (≤150 words) 
This project looks at how a U.S. tech services firm can protect itself from exchange rate changes on a 12,500,000 receivable due in one year. The current EURUSD spot rate is 1.1632, which means each euro is worth about $1.16. If the euro weakens, the company would get fewer dollars when the payemnt arrives. To manage this risk, the analysis compares three strategies: a forward contract, a money market hedge, and an options hedge. The goal is to recommend the most effective strategy that stabilizes cash flows and limits downside risk.

## Background & Objectives
The company faces uncertainty because exchange rates can change significantly over time, affecting the value of its future foreign payments. Even small shifts in the euro to dollar rate can impact reported budgets and cash flow. Managing this risk is important for maintaing financial results and protecting profit margins. The main goal of this project is to design a clear apprach to best protect the company from losing money if the euro weakens. To do this, the project will test different hedging methods and compare how well they work in different market situations.

## Methods
To acheive the objectives of the project I will be using a step by step approach to compare different ways of managing currency risk. 
1. Current market data will be collected including the EURUSD spot rate, forward rate, and interest rates for both currencies. These numbers will be used to calculate how much the company would receive in U.S. dollars under hedging strategy.
2. Using Excel, I will test 3 methods: forward contract, a money market hedge, and an options hedge. This excel feature will estimate dollar outcomes if the exchange rate changes by different amounts.
3. The results will be compared to see which hedge offers the best mix of protection and cost. I will be using charts and summary tables to see which option performs better.

## Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations: Our analysis assumes current marekt rates remain stable when the hedge is executed. This prototype does not include operational or tax impacts of hedging decisions. It may be hard to gather all the infromation and intergrate it into the prototype.

Next Steps: Confirm data on latest spot, forward, and interest rates asap with the finance team. Build the excel prototype with the treasury team to implement the testing of the three hedging strategies.
