## A. Exposure Summary (Stage 2 Reference)

As defined in **Stage 2 – Technical Specification**, the firm expects to receive:

- **EUR Receivable:** €12,500,000  
- **Time Horizon:** 1 year  
- **Exposure Type:** Transaction exposure  
- **Functional Currency:** USD  

Because the receivable is denominated in euros while reporting and budgeting are in U.S. dollars, the firm is exposed to fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. A depreciation of the euro reduces USD cash inflows, while an appreciation increases USD proceeds but introduces uncertainty.

The objective across Stages 2–4 is to **protect USD cash flows** while evaluating the tradeoff between **certainty and flexibility** across hedging instruments.

## B. Summary of Hedge Outcomes (Stage 4 Model Results)

Using the **Stage 4 Excel hedging model**, three strategies were evaluated under identical assumptions and named ranges.

### Forward Hedge
- Locks in the 1-year forward rate of **1.0890 USD/EUR**.
- Guaranteed USD proceeds equal to:  
  **€12,500,000 × 1.0890 = $13,612,500**
- Eliminates all FX uncertainty regardless of future spot rates.

### Money Market Hedge
- Replicates a forward hedge using interest rate parity.
- Produces **near-identical USD proceeds** to the forward hedge in the Stage 4 model.
- Minor differences reflect funding mechanics rather than FX risk.

### Option Hedge
- Establishes a downside floor while preserving upside potential.
- USD proceeds vary depending on the terminal spot rate (**Sₜ**):
  - Downside protection when EUR depreciates
  - Upside participation when EUR appreciates
- Net proceeds are reduced by the **upfront option premium**, as shown in Stage 4.

Overall, the Stage 4 outputs show that **forward and money market hedges maximize certainty**, while **options introduce flexibility at a measurable cost**.

## C. Sensitivity Interpretation (Stage 3 Logic Applied)

### EUR Depreciation Scenario (Sₜ < Strike)
- **Forward Hedge:** USD proceeds remain fixed at $13.61M.
- **Money Market Hedge:** USD proceeds remain effectively fixed.
- **Option Hedge:** Option is exercised, limiting downside losses, though net proceeds are reduced by the premium.

### EUR Appreciation Scenario (Sₜ > Strike)
- **Forward Hedge:** No participation in favorable FX movements.
- **Money Market Hedge:** No upside participation.
- **Option Hedge:** Higher USD proceeds realized as spot appreciation outweighs the premium cost.

### Key Tradeoffs Observed in Stage 4
- **Certainty:** Forward ≈ Money Market > Options  
- **Flexibility:** Options > Forward ≈ Money Market  
- **Cost Transparency:** Forward > Money Market > Options

## D. Strategic Recommendation

**Recommended Strategy: Forward Hedge**

Based on the Stage 4 quantitative results and the firm’s stated objective of USD cash flow protection, the forward hedge is the most appropriate strategy.

The forward hedge:
- Fully eliminates FX risk
- Produces known USD proceeds of **$13.61M**
- Avoids upfront premium costs
- Minimizes operational and balance sheet complexity

While the option hedge provides upside participation, the premium represents an explicit cost that is inconsistent with a non-speculative treasury mandate.

---

## E. Executive Justification

From a CFO and treasury management perspective, the forward hedge best supports:

- **Cash Flow Stability:** Guaranteed USD inflows
- **Budget Certainty:** No FX-related earnings volatility
- **Liquidity Preservation:** No premium paid upfront
- **Operational Simplicity:** Clean execution and documentation
- **Accounting Clarity:** Straightforward hedge accounting treatment

The strategy aligns with conservative corporate risk management principles rather than return-seeking behavior.

## Extra Credit – Areas for Further Study & Improvement

### 1. OpenAI Codex / Code Interpreter
Codex could:
- Validate Stage 4 hedge formulas automatically
- Convert the Excel model into Python
- Run Monte Carlo FX simulations across thousands of Sₜ outcomes
- Regenerate audit-ready models on demand  

This reduces operational risk and strengthens model governance.

### 2. Claude Skills (Automation & Live Data Integration)
Claude Skills could:
- Pull live FX spot rates and yield curves
- Auto-update hedge outcomes
- Regenerate spreadsheets and executive summaries
- Validate calculations before hedge execution  

This enables real-time treasury decision support.

### 3. GitHub Automation & Version Control (Required)

**What Version Control Is**
- Every model change is committed and traceable
- Full revision history is permanent and reversible
- Prevents silent spreadsheet errors

**Why It Matters in Finance**
- Supports hedge accounting documentation
- Strengthens internal controls
- Preserves data lineage and auditability

**Workflow Across Stages 2–4**
- Stage 2: Specifications versioned
- Stage 3: Logic and assumptions reviewed
- Stage 4: Models regenerated consistently from prompts  

GitHub enables consistent, auditable model regeneration.

### 4. Accounting & Audit Integration
- Supports OCI vs. P&L hedge accounting documentation
- Enables reproducible hedge effectiveness testing
- GitHub commit history serves as audit evidence
