# Stage 5 – Final Analysis & Recommendation (6 Points)
**Due:** December 12, 2025

## Goal
Deliver a polished, executive-ready memo or slide deck summarizing your hedge analysis and recommending the best strategy. This combines quantitative rigor, interpretation, communication, and forward-looking perspective — exactly what senior finance leaders expect from analysts.

**Hint:** Think of this as just another step ("final analysis memo prompt") and have your LLM generate the output based on your **Stage 4 - Spreadsheet**.

---

## 1. Claude Skills (Automation & Live Data Integration)
Claude Skills can:
- Pull live FX spot rates and yields  
- Update models automatically  
- Regenerate spreadsheets on demand  
- Validate hedge calculations  
- Produce instant summary reports  

Explain how a Skill could automate or improve your model.

---

## 2. OpenAI Codex / Code Interpreter

---

## 3. Claude Code / Multi-File Reasoning
Claude can:
- Read & update multiple files (Excel, CSV, MD)  
- Create dashboards or charts  
- Maintain consistency across versions  
- Automate model rebuilding  

Explain how multi-file reasoning enhances your modeling workflow.

## 4. GitHub Automation & Version Control (Required Discussion)

### What Version Control Is
- Each change becomes a committed revision  
- Full history is permanent & reversible  
- Prevents silent spreadsheet errors  
- Builds auditability & transparency  

### Why It Matters in Finance
Finance relies on:
- Hedge accounting documentation  
- Internal controls  
- Data lineage  
- Multi-user workflows  

### How Collaboration Works
- Branching for parallel work  
- Pull Requests for review  
- GitHub Actions for automated testing/validation  
- Issue tracking for model updates  

Tie this to your Stages 2–4:
> “Specs, model templates, and AI prompts can all be versioned in GitHub to enable consistent, auditable model regeneration.”

---

## 5. Accounting / Audit Integration
Explain relevance:
- OCI vs P&L hedge accounting flows  
- Documentation requirements  
- Importance of reproducibility  
- GitHub as audit evidence
